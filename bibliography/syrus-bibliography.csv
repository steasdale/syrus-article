"5QJW82K7","book","2011","Christie, Neil","The Fall of the Western Roman Empire: An Archaeological and Historical Perspective","","978-1-84966-337-3","","","","The decline of the Roman Empire has been a subject of fascination and debate for centuries. In this original new work, Neil Christie draws on numerous sources, interweaving the latest archaeological evidence, to reconstruct the period's landscape and events. In the process, he rethinks some of historians' most widely held and long-established views: Was the Empire's disintegration caused primarily by external or internal factors? Why did the Eternal City of Old Rome collapse in the West, while the 'New Rome' of Constantinople endured in the East? What was destroyed and what remained of Roman culture after successive invasions by Vandals, Goths, Huns and other 'barbarians', and what was the impact of the new Christian religion? As Christie expertly demonstrates, the archaeology of the late Roman period reveals intriguing answers to these and other questions. Taking an innovative, interdisciplinary approach that combines traditional historical methods and a unique familiarity with the Empire's physical remnants, he uncovers new aspects of Rome's military struggles, its shifting geography, and the everyday lives of its subjects.","2011","2017-05-30 18:24:43","2023-02-15 20:50:18","","","xi, 306 p.","","","","","The Fall of the Western Roman Empire","Historical Endings","","","","Bloomsbury Academic","London","English","","","","","University of Toronto","DG311 .C634","","","G:\My Drive\Library\Monographs\Christie - 2011 - The Fall of the Western Roman Empire.

"88VHW7R8","book","2006","Christie, Neil","From Constantine to Charlemagne: An Archaeology of Italy, AD 300–800","","978-1-85928-421-6","","","","This book offers an overview of the archaeological and structural evidence for one of the most vital periods of Italian history, spanning the late Roman and early medieval periods. The chronological scope covers the adoption of Christianity and the emergence of Rome as the seat of Western Christendom, the break-up of the Roman west in the face of internal decay and the settlement of non-Romans and Germanic groups, the impact of Germanic and Byzantine rule on Italy until the rise of Charlemagne and of a Papal State in the later eighth century. Presenting a detailed review and analysis of recent discoveries by archaeologists, historians, art historians, numismatists and architectural historians, Neil Christie identifies the changes brought about by the Church in town and country, the level of change within Italy under Rome before and after occupation by Ostrogoths, Byzantines and Lombards, and reviews wider changes in urbanism, rural exploitation and defence. The emphasis is on human settlement on its varied levels - town, country, fort, refuge - and the assessment of how these evolved and the changes that impacted on them. Too long neglected as a 'Dark Age', this book helps to further illuminate this fascinating and dynamic period of European history.","2006","2017-05-30 18:27:40","2023-02-15 20:48:13","","","xvii, 586 p.","","","","","From Constantine to Charlemagne","","","","","Ashgate Publishing","Aldershot","English","","","","","University of Toronto","DG311 .F76","","","G:\My Drive\Library\Monographs\Christie - 2006 - From Constantine to Charlemagne.

La provincia della Liguria, rapidamente privata di legami terrestri con le altre zone imperiali sopravvissute, ha visto una rapida militarizzazione della sua amministrazione, rimedio supremo nella sua lotta per contrastare l'invasione longobarda. Sebbene solo sporadicamente documentata dalle fonti letterarie, la Liguria beneficia di una messe di dati archeologici, soprattutto in forma di repertori tipologici dettagliati da scavi urbani (fra cui Luni, Albenga e Ventimiglia), che forniscono indicazioni importanti sulle trasformazioni sociali presenti in questa fase così poco studiata. Sistemi di popolamento urbano, militare e rurale sono ampiamente esaminati e riportati all'interno di un'intelaiatura politica, militare e amministrativa della provincia e in generale dell'Italia bizantina.

But Genoa was also one of medieval Europe's major centers of trade and commerce. In Genoa and the Genoese, 958-1528, Steven Epstein has written the first comprehensive history of the city that traces its transformation from an obscure port into the capital of a small but thriving republic with an extensive overseas empire. In a series of chronological chapters, Epstein bridges six centuries of medieval and Renaissance history by skillfully interweaving the four threads of political events, economic trends, social conditions, and cultural accomplishments. He provides considerable new evidence on social themes and also examines other subjects important to Genoa's development, such as religion, the Crusades, the city's long and combative relations with the Muslim world, the environment, and epidemic disease, giving this book a scope that encompasses the entire Mediterranean. Along with the nobles and merchants who governed the city, Epstein profiles the ordinary men and women of Genoa. Genoa and the Genoese, 958-1528 displays the full richness and eclectic nature of the Genoese people during their most vibrant centuries.","1996","2013-09-11 01:23:12","2019-08-26 16:30:50","","","420 p.","","","","","Genoa and the Genoese","","","","","University of North Carolina Press","Chapel Hill","English","","","","","University of Toronto","DG637 .E67","","","G:\My Drive\Library\Monographs\Epstein - 1996 - Genoa and the Genoese, 958–1528.pdf","","1400s; Genoa; Mediterranean; Slavery; 1500s; Wills (Testaments); 1100s; 1200s; 1300s; Liguria (Italy); Naples (Campania); Caffa; Casa di S.

Genoese history under Byzantines, Lombards, Carolingians and Ottonians is compared with that of other coastal settlements, including Albenga, Noli, Perti and Savona and the less-studied but fascinating inland valleys, the Aveto, Polcevera, Stura and Vara.

Many archaeologists have argued exactly that: Lombard Italy was essentially a rural society, of low population and its cities were merely places of the imagination. Others, usually historians, have argued that it was an urbanised society but that its urban centres were poor. The Barrington Atlas, the definitive mapping of the ancient Greek and Roman worlds published nearly two decades ago, shows clearly that Mediolanum was at the centre of a largely centuriated agricultural hinterland and was a place that was well connected via an extensive road network to neighbouring towns and cities. The flight of Honoratus is, however, problematically documented for there is no strictly contemporary evidence, either for the bishop himself or his supposed escape to Genoa.","2021","2022-11-24 17:19:53","2022-11-24 17:21:18","","304-323","","","","","","Urban life in Lombard Italy","","","","","Routledge","Abingdon, Oxon","English","","","","","","","","","G:\My Drive\Library\Articles\Balzaretti - 2021 - Urban life in Lombard Italy.

"8FB8K622","thesis","2021","Garcia, Mariechristine","Gregory the Great’s Rivers: Environment and Hagiography in Sixth Century Italy","","","","","","Gregory the Great has been the focus of many studies that discuss the transition of Italy from late antiquity to a medieval period. He was witness to the dissolution of the infrastructure of empire in the Italian peninsula, shifting and redistribution of populations after the Lombard invasion, and the increased need for the pastoral care of bishops in these new settlements. Hemispheric climate change and the first plague pandemic also stressed the population of Italy. It is under this social and environmental upheaval that Gregory writes his hagiography collection, the Dialogues. In this thesis I argue that Gregory’s ecological literature is reflective not only of the seemingly apocalyptic environment that Gregory lives through, but of a current of cultural change as well. In looking at the destruction of natural world through Gregory’s fluvial literature and relevant palaeoclimatological records, this study identifies how Gregory’s landscape changes when human agents (bishops) and natural agents (rivers) come into conflict, and how that may be reflective of the peninsula’s historical climate changes in the sixth century. Gregory identifies the natural world, in this case rivers, as a powerful force of change that is challenged by bishops and their responsibility to protect the communities they serve. These conflicts between bishops and their local rivers are central to Gregory’s attempt at depicting how pre-Christian and Christian elements function in an environment under such social, political, and climatological stressors.","2021","2023-02-15 21:28:09","2023-02-15 21:29:56","","","61 p.","","","","","Gregory the Great’s Rivers","","","","","University of Nevada","Nevada","English","","M.A. Thesis","","","","","","","G:\My Drive\Library\Monographs\Garcia - 2021 - Gregory the Great’s Rivers.

It develops themes first proposed in 1978 by Brown who stressed the role of insecurity and the militarisation of society in promoting seulement change in the imperial territories, in particular through the creation of castra. Besides examining the origin and nature of these castra, and their position in current thinking on the later process of incastellamento, comment is also made on the effects of Byzantine rule on the cities of Italy, assessing levels of continuity and change. The paper is divided into two halves : in the first part the regions of Venetia and the Exarchate are surveyed from a primarily documentary viewpoint in the second half archaeological data provide physical image of settlement change in Liguria and central Italy The combina tion of these various sources of evidence allow important conclusions to be drawn regarding the character of Byzantine rule and settlement in Italy","1989","2023-02-17 20:53:47","2023-02-17 20:56:13","","377-399","","2","101","","MEFR","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","G:\My Drive\Library\Articles\Brown and Christie - 1989 - Was there a Byzantine model of settlement in Italy.pdf","","Mediterranean; 500s; 600s; 700s; Liguria (Italy); Byzantine Empire; Italy (Europe)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"SU6LDTV6","book","2009","Hughes, Ian","Belisarius: The Last Roman General","","978-1-59416-085-1","","","","Belisarius (c. 505–565 AD) was the greatest general of the Eastern Roman Empire and is among history's most notable military personalities. At the age of 29, he twice defeated the Persians and reconquered North Africa from the Vandals, before going on to regain the Italian peninsula from the Ostrogoths, including the Eternal City, Rome. Fighting in the name of Justinian I, Belisarius recaptured large portions of the original territory of the ancient Roman Empire. However, Byzantium was both unwilling and incapable of retaining much of Belisarius's hard-won advances, and soon after his death, the empire once again retracted. In ""Belisarius: The Last Roman General"", historian Ian Hughes recounts the life of this great soldier. In addition, he explains the evolution of classical Roman armies and systems of warfare into those of the Byzantine Empire, as well as those of their chief enemies, the Persians, Goths, and Vandals. Based on ancient source and drawing on a wealth of modern research, Belisarius's career is set in the context of the turbulent times in which he lived and his reputation is reassessed to give a balanced portrait of this neglected giant among ancient commanders.","2009","2024-10-01 21:45:18","2025-07-11 17:55:04","","","xv, 272 p.","","","","","Belisarius","","","","","Westholme Publications","Yardley","English","","","","","University of Toronto","DF572.8 .B4 H84 2009 ROBARTS","","","","","Mediterranean; Military History; Antiquity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
