## Introduction and summary

Should I mention the hymn? Manetti? Stella?

See the introductions provided by Everett for examples (and in Everett’s book itself)

The cult of Syrus of Genoa is created as a result of convergence of a number of issues

## Analysis: The Life of Syrus

A very Janus-like life… first part looks northward, to early medieval Genoa… the second part looks southwards, out to the sea, reflecting later medieval Genoa.

The second part can be seen as an appeal for support from the emergent and increasingly powerful—both politically and financially—merchant class.

- It suggests that they had a role in the spread of Christianity.
- The character is secular ???
- He is a trader (??) and a sailor (most certainly) with pan-Mediterranean contacts, assuming that Libya means Libya
- Serves to remind the Genoese that the spirit of St. Syrus could accompany them on their long and often dangerous voyages

Written at an apex, mid 11^th^ century, of the transformation of Genoa from minor suffragan to Milan to Mediterranean naval power.

Could perhaps provide insights into the changing nature of Genoese society, and the role of the church in the local power struggles.

## Themes of the Life

The basilisk is an important one… the breath.

He doesn’t kill the basilisk, but returns it to the sea?

Leads the group to townspeople to the site.

Syrus works first miracle, as we have seen with other cases, on elite Roman

He is banished for inappropriate display of piety … any precedence for this?

Translation of relics to Libya… look into claims made by the Bollandist whether this means Africa or just some place on the Italian coast

Syrus dies relatively early in this Life, perhaps even before the half-way point. What does this say about the emphasis? How does this compare with the other hagiographies we have studied

## The historical Syrus

Mention of him in Gregory

Everett and the translatio—E suggests that the text was really about Syrus of Pavia.

## What about the monastery/church of S. Siro

When was it founded? What was the relationship between the church and the saint, other than name? Where was the well?

Carolingian Liguria

Unlike Milan and Pavia, with their strong central histories to both the Lombard and Carolingian kingdom, and where the church was a powerful political force and substantial landholder, it was a relatively minor property holder within the urbs of Genoa

- San Siro / San Lorenzo
- Majority of properties in the Levante
- Reflective of the Ligurian coast during the 10-11c as a collection of relatively large towns, with no single town (i.e. Genoa) yet dominant; as such, the center/periphery model appropriate to other northern Italian cities at this time does not really apply in Liguria.
- Reflects the decline in Genoa (both politically, religiously, and economically) following the Byzantine era (real or perceived declines)
- Also, there exists evidence of climate change perhaps making the port of Genoa very shallow for a few centuries.

11c sees an increased desire for independence from Milanese influence

## Authorship

Curious reflection on the nature of authorship (have we seen this before?)

Requiring a notary: perhaps the belief that this document could have legal implications with regards to land claims? Or perhaps the author was illiterate? The Bollandist claims Oberto as author, who was a bishop. What common was illiteracy among bishops?

Also, were there attempts during this early stage to claim an archbishopric for Genoa? Any evidence for early ecclesiastical tensions between Genoa and Milan (or Pavia, for that matter?)

## Contextualization: Historiographical issues

Two versions of Genoese rise during 11c: sudden vs. gradual. Does this document lend credence to either?

Why has this been largely ignored in studies of Genoese history (no translations, it seems?)

Did Syrus ever exist? See Everett, for example.

## The afterlife

Giorgio and Giovanni Stella

Manetti

In art and literature

## Miscellanea

During Carolingian rule Genoa was just one of several large towns on the Ligurian coast (which included La Spezia, etc.) and Carolingian naval power was based in Lucca (Kedar, Crusade, 26)

In 711 refugees from Spain bring the relics of San Fruttoso to the Ligurian coast, building a new monastery at Capodemonte (Epstein 14)

During the first century of Lombard rule in N. Italy the archbishops of Milan use Genoa as a place of refuge. See in particular the letters of Gregory to various figures in Genoa. See De Negri, Storia di Genoa, 108-11 (on the early church) and 163

Cathedral conflicts: S. Siro vs. S. Lorenzo and the tenth century rise of S. Siro as the unofficial patron saint of Genoa (to be later eclipsed by S. Giorgio in the Reniassance).
